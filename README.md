Employee Social Media Activity Dataset
This dataset contains information about employees who have agreed to promote the company's products on social media. The table includes the following columns:
•	emp_ID: Unique identifier for each employee
•	Date_posted: Date on which the employee posted content
Important Note: Employees can post multiple times in a single day.
Analysis Goals
1.	Employee Posting Frequency: We will analyze the dataset to determine the number of social media posts each employee made during the specified period.
2.	Highly Active Employees: We will identify employees who were particularly active on social media, specifically those who posted seven or more times within a week.
3.	Monthly Posting Trends: We will examine the number of posts made by each employee on a monthly basis.
4.	Joint Posting Activity: We will identify dates where both Employee ID 6 and Employee ID 9 actively participated in social media posting.
